# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to manage GitHub project items (cards) and integrate with Claude Code or similar AI tools. The project is currently in its initial stages with only basic documentation and licensing in place.

## Current State

The repository contains:
- Basic README.md describing the project purpose
- MIT License from Qugnition Labs (2025)
- No source code, package.json, or build configuration yet

## Development Setup

Since this project is in its initial phase, the development environment and build system are not yet established. Future development will likely require:

1. Setting up a package.json for Node.js/TypeScript development
2. Installing MCP server dependencies
3. Configuring GitHub API integration
4. Setting up build and test scripts

## Architecture (Planned)

Based on the project description, this will be an MCP server that:
- Manages GitHub project items/cards
- Integrates with AI tools like Claude Code
- Provides programmatic access to GitHub project management features

## Next Steps for Development

When continuing development on this project:
1. Initialize package.json with MCP server dependencies
2. Set up TypeScript configuration for MCP development
3. Implement GitHub API integration for project management
4. Create MCP server endpoints for project item operations
5. Add authentication and authorization for GitHub access
6. Implement error handling and logging
7. Add comprehensive tests

## Important Notes

- This project uses MIT License (Copyright 2025 Qugnition Labs)
- Focus on defensive security practices when implementing GitHub API access
- Ensure proper authentication handling for GitHub integration
